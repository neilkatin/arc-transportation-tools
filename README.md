ARC Transportation tool
=======================

This is a small tool to ease management of the DTT when doing LOG-TRA-SA tasks.

The tool merges the Vehicles excel output with the arrival roster to merge the two together.
This makes hunting down missing cards easier.  You get the contact and checking info from the Staff Roster
right alongside the missing cars.

The tool only outputs vehicles of type 'R' (rental) and without a Key #.
